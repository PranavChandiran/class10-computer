# 💻 Class 10 CBSE Computer HTML Practice Code

This repo contains the HTML code I practiced before my **Class 10 CBSE Computer Applications exam**. ✏️📘

It includes most of the important topics from the syllabus:

- 📊 Tables  
- 📝 Forms  
- 🔗 Hyperlinks  
- 📋 Ordered & Unordered Lists  
- 🎵🎥 Audio and Video Tags  
- 🧩 Other important HTML tags

I created and practiced this code before my exam, and it helped me revise everything properly.  
💯 I scored **99 out of 100** in the subject!
